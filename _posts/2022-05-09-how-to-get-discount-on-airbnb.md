This is how I recently got a $1,000 discount on Airbnb. I was in Playa del Carmen, Mexico and I had to move out within 1 week so I went on Airbnb and managed to get myself a deal a few days before I had to move out.

The process is rather simple and I'm surprised I didn't use it before in my travels.

**Note:** this may not work every time but it is worth a try, so here we go.

### Timing

You want to do this either 1 week or as close to your date of travel as possible because the landlord or property managers would want to fill up their space and earn some money.

Or you can do this a few months out to give you enough time and to have more options to book giving you a chance to book an even better place.

### The Process

1. Find accommodation on Airbnb - this is super simple
2. Email the Host
3. You can directly contact the host via Airbnb.
4. Don't forget to create a script, so you can copy paste it and save yourself some time. **The script I used is below.**
5. Wait for their reply
6. Usually, they will either agree, offer another price, deny or not reply at all
7. Decide which place you like and accept the offer

**The script**

[Note: There was a screenshot of the script in the original, but the text was not clearly visible in the HTML]

As I mentioned, the process is super simple. It just requires you to put a little bit of work and reach out to the hosts.

### The "other" process

What you can also do is figure out how you can get in touch with the owners outside of Airbnb. As a result, you can save on Airbnb Fees & Taxes that may come up.

* **Note:** This is against Airbnb policy so don't do it on their platform. Otherwise you or the landlord run risk of being banned.

**So how do you avoid doing it on the Airbnb platform?**

Depending on the building that is being rented you can find a direct contact for it and reach out to the property manager.

* Sometimes users leave the name of a property in the reviews.
* And other times, the property managers put their company name as the contact and not their name. So a quick google of their company name can do you wonders but you got to weigh up if this is worth the hassle.

And that's basically it. It is a short guide but very actionable. Give it a try and see how you go. In no time you will be getting a discount on your Airbnb. **Use it wisely!**
