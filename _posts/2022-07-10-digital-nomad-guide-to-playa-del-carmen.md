So I've been living in Playa del Carmen, Mexico for the last 7 months and figured it would be good to write a blog on how to setup quickly in Playa del Carmen.

After all, when arriving at a new place I want to get things going as soon as possible, so I can live a normal life.

### Getting to PDC

First thing first, to arrive to Playa you will be landing in Cancun International Airport. From there, hop on the ADO bus which will take you directly into Playa Centro.

The total cost will be about 250 pesos for a 1 hour chill ride with an AC. If you are feeling luxurious, then get a taxi for 800 pesos.

Once in Playa, you need to sort out your accommodation.

### Where to live in Playa Del Carmen & How to find accommodation

I recommend living in the Centro area highlighted in the photo, which is between the 1st and 76th or so.. However you can live outside and it will be much cheaper. Or you can live in a gated community like Playacar and be fancier.

Easiest way to find accommodation quick is obviously Airbnb but it won't be the cheapest option.

The next best option is to go on Facebook marketplace and see what is available out there. Some of the listings are outdated and been around for a while, and at times the people don't reply to you but don't get discouraged as eventually you will find something. I like to filter by newest listings and message them ASAP. The competition is fierce out there.

Also checkout my guide: **How to get a discount on AirBnB**.

If you are planning to stay at least a few months it may make sense to sign a lease for 6 months, as you get a cheaper rate. If you decide to leave, you will only be losing your 1 month deposit. However, before signing up make sure you do the maths that it is worth breaking the lease. It is something I wish I did, as I ended up staying for 7 months but I didn't know at the time.

Lastly, you can take a bicycle and ride neighbourhoods looking for WhatsApp numbers and advertisements that are hung right on the buildings. Once you got the number, contact the people directly.

Personally, I found my accommodation through Facebook marketplace. I filtered it by newest and it was listed 3 hours ago, messaged and went to see it that day. I left with a signed contract. Make sure you bring some cash for a deposit, so they keep the place for you.

The other time, I organised my accommodation via Airbnb using the guide **How to get a discount on AirBnB**.

So once you sorted your accommodations, if you are like me, then you need a Sim card with lots of data. If it's not for you, then you can skip to next section.

### SIM cards

I believe you only have two options TelCel and AT&T. I went with AT&T because I was offered the most amount of data per month which was about 10 gigs. It costed 500 pesos and was enough for me to last a month without running out.

If you are a citizen of the US you get some nice plans from US that you can use in Mexico. My friend is doing that and I'm super jealous of him.

Now that your Sim card is sorted it is time to hit the gym.

### Gyms - Which gym should you go to?

If you do a quick Google Maps search, you will find that Playa has a bunch of different gyms to offer, whether you are looking for normal gym, boxing or anything else. As such, you should have no problem finding something close to your accommodation and it's all relatively cheap.

I've been going to the Evolve gym here, which is probably the most popular gym in Playa. It costs about 1000 pesos a month, which is about $50 USD. One thing to note, it does get very busy, so if it's not your thing then you better off finding another gym.

I have been doing mainly calisthenics and free weights, so very rarely have to wait for any machines. Another added benefit is the people that go there are pretty sexy, so the vibe is definitely nice. At the same time, it has a bit of that Instagram influencer vibe.

If you are looking for a **free option**, then check out the stadium Deportivo Mario Villanueva Madrid. It has free calisthenics gym, tennis courts, running track, dancing classes, acro yoga and much more. People get together there in the evenings and workout, it is a nice vibe ðŸ‘Œ I recommend you check it out.

So gym is sorted, how do you get there?

### Getting around Playa del Carmen & Beyond

**BiciPlaya**

I recommend getting a yearly membership at BiciPlaya and you will have access to these bicycles until 11 pm for 45 minutes at a time. You pick them up and park them at their stations. It is super convenient and you don't worry about your bicycle being stolen.

Just make sure you lock the bike and don't use it after hours as the fees can add up. Few times I forgot to lock the bike and they charged me, but I messaged them via WhatsApp and they managed to clear those as it was an accident.

**Buying a bicycle**

You can visit a Facebook marketplace and buy yourself a bicycle for 1,000 pesos or lessâ€¦ or more if you fancy. Get a lock with it, as the bikes get stolen here often even if you have a lock. So I would be careful with where you leave it. Few of my friends had their bicycles stolen. It's only 1000 pesos but still the feeling is no bueno. As such, BiciPlaya does the job for me.

**Taxi**

There is **no Uber here,** so you will be forced to use local taxis. Getting a taxi is a good way to get around especially late at night, or if you want to avoid the heat. I'm warning you in advance that be prepared to be ripped off, especially if you are new. However, even the locals the taxi drivers try to rip off. It all depends where you get the taxi.

If the taxi is standing next to a hotel, you will be getting charged double or triple for the price. Try not to get taxis there and instead walk few meters to a busy road and you will be able to get a taxi for a cheaper rate.

Playa del Carmen has a bunch of different WhatsApp groups for taxis which works exactly like Uber. You message them, send your location of where you are and they pick you up and take you where you need to go. I use them a bit, its convenient and they charge a fair rate.

The standard rate in the Centro of Playa is about 50 pesos. Paying anything more than that and you are getting ripped off. You will have times like this, it is part of the experience so I'm just warning you in advance.

**Colectivos**

Small vans that go pretty much anywhere, as long as they go in the direction that you want to go they will be able to drop you off on the way.

This is a great way to get around, especially if you want to go to Tulum. Only 50 pesos, and they go every 5 minutes. There will be no AirCon and be a bit cramped, but it's fast, convenient and cheap. You can find Colectivos in Playa del Carmen here.

They also drive around the city, so be on the lookout.

**ADO Bus**

You probably caught this bus on your way from Cancun. If you didn't, this is one of my favourite ways to get around nearby regions in Mexico. Go on their website and buy the tickets online. Great service that is cheap, always on time, comfy seats with AirConâ€¦ what else could you ask for?

I used this to go to Bacalar, Tulum, Holbox as well as Cancun Airport many times. It never fails.

**Car Rentals**

If you want to rent a car, which I've done a few times, then I recommend walking into FireFly located here.

**Why do I say walk in?** Because turns out you can get a cheaper rate by walking in versus doing it online, insane right? Be mindful though if it is super busy, then you might be out of luck so go in early.

Another way to book cars is through WhatsApp groups where locals rent out their cars to you. They deliver the car to your door and pick it up, it is very convenient and the price is usually good.

**Music & Parties**

If you like electronic music, then I recommend going to:

* Santino
* Lobo del Mar
* 3B
* Bali Rooftop
* Iszla Hostel

However, I like to go to Tulum for some great parties every now and then. I recommend you visit www.tulum.party to see what is on right now. This allows me to keep Playa for work and go to Tulum to blow off some steam.

**Food**

There are many good restaurants around Playa and places you can check out and explore, so I will let you do that on your own.

However, one thing that I enjoyed doing is having a **meal plan**. If you don't mind having the same food, which eventually will happen, then I recommend using **Food O'Clock**.

They delivery lunch & dinner to you daily and for me it removed the headache of what to eat and prepare on daily basis. I enjoy that, so if you are like me, then give that a try.

And on the weekends, I would go out and explore different places.

I also recommend you install **Rappi** to get that on demand Uber Eats like experience. You can also order supermarket food and so on. However, for that I recommend making an account with Walmart and they can deliver to you.

I've been using Walmart on weekly basis and it was great for your daily things.

**Local Activity Groups**

One thing I want to mention is the local activity groups like dancing, creation, acro yoga, Shibari and many more. You will find that a lot of things are organised here via WhatsApp groups, so make sure you ask and find the group that you are looking for.

There is an initial list that was created by someone that you can find here, so check it out.

By joining a group this will be the fastest way for you to make some new friends :)

And I think that's it to getting started in Playa del Carmen.

If you have any questions, please reach out. I hope you find this guide useful.

Much love
