## Or how I got it in 14 days ðŸ˜Ž

If you want to skip the storyline and get to the steps, then scroll to "How to Get Permanent or Temporary Residency in Mexico", otherwise enjoy the little story of how it all happened.

Ok, so this is a story of how I got a Permanent Residency in Mexico in 14 days and it only cost me $938 USD, if I don't count the flights and expenses related to it. I am treating them as a vacation expense. With the flights and accommodation, it was probably around $2,000 USD (quick maths).

## The beginning

It was my first time in Mexico and I was going there to escape the lockdowns in New Zealand. At the same time, the plan was to spend two months there, see if I like it, and then go to Costa Rica to explore it and decide between the two countries.

Well, that didn't go according to plan and five months later I'm still in Mexico.

Before coming to Mexico, I did notice some people talking about how it is becoming difficult to get 180 days on your tourist visa. To which I thought that having a New Zealand passport and it being my first time, I should be fine. I mean, why wouldn't you want to give someone 180 days, if they want to explore your country or so I thought.

I arrived at Cancun International Airport, went through the immigration, and got this Tourist card.

Had a quick look at this squiggle and, without giving it a second thought, I left the airport. I mean, nothing was written in the official day box (highlighted in red on the image), so I just assumed it was 180 days. ðŸ˜…

## Two weeks later...

Two weeks go by and I notice more conversations are happening amongst people around the whole Tourist card and not getting 180 days upon the arrival. I checked mine and realised that it looks like I got 9 days. "Oh ðŸ’©", I thought to myself. Immediately, I asked my friend for a lawyer and contacted them.

They confirmed that it is 9 days, so I decided to contact another lawyer. They said that what is written there is illegal and you have 180 days. I'm like great, which one do I trust. After discussing with the lawyers a bit more and doing my own research, I had 4 options:

1. Fly out and fly back in, and hopefully get 180 days. There was also a chance of getting less again or being denied entry.
2. Apply for residency, which means getting all documents and flying out of the country, most likely to New Zealand.
3. Stay and find out if the second lawyer can do something about my situation. However, run the risk of being picked up by immigration while walking on the street and getting deported.
4. Give up and go to Costa Rica or any other place.

Being opportunistic, I decided to go with Option 3 and see if the lawyer could work her magic. The lawyer said that I should avoid public transport, and stay low and out of sight. Not going to lie, it was a stressful time for me, especially after hearing recent stories of people getting deported.

A week goes by and unfortunately, nothing could be done in my situation.

Me being already super stressed, I decided to go with Option 2. I contacted a bunch of consulates in the US and there was no luck. All of them required some form of official verification of my documents. This would take time and frankly was too much hassle for me. Looks like I may have to go to New Zealand to get my residency, except it's in a COVID lockdown.

## What happened next...

I don't remember exactly but somehow I ended up in the office of the first lawyer, and she said that I need to email the Kansas City consulate and see if they will accept my documents. According to her, they are more lenient and in fact, have been known to give Mexican Permanent Residency to applicants, while other consulates only give out Temporary Residency.

So I did exactly that. I emailed and a few days later they replied saying I can submit my documents by email or post. So of course, I emailed. Another 2 weeks go by and I get no reply. Meanwhile, I spoke to a guy who was going through the same process and had the same issue. However, when he mailed his documents they got back to him within a week.

Straight away I went and printed hundred of pages, filled out my application, snuck a $50 note between all the papers (as you can't send money using DHL), ran to DHL, and submitted my documents to them before they closed. This was on Monday.

One thing I forgot to mention is that I also had a flight to Austin, Texas that week on Wednesday. I was so stressed before that I decided to do a visa run, just in case.

## **MÃ©xico MÃ¡gico**

This is where the Magic of Mexico begins. It's Wednesday, I arrive at the Cancun airport and go to the immigration office to get my stamp out of the country. However, before getting that, I ask them to confirm how many days I have. They say 180 days. I ask them, "why does it say 9 there?". To which, they had no answer but they were certain I have 180 days. I ask them to check in the system and they can't do it. And that if I want to check the days, I have to go to immigration in Cancun and I'm not risking that, as I could get deported.

So I ask them if they could write 180 days on the card, thinking to myself that this is an easy fix and then I don't have to fly to Austin and this whole visa situation could be avoided. They say, "No".

I was so confused at that moment but still thought there is hope. So finally I asked, what happens if the police stop me and see this 9, what do I do? And of course, they didn't have an answer for that.

I'm like great, after this interaction and a quick call to my lawyer, I decided to fly to Austin. I got my stamp from the immigration that I'm okay to leave the country. I didn't pay any fines, which was funny, despite supposedly "being over the limit".

So what gives? The immigration officers upon entry do one thing, the lawyers say another, and immigration upon exit says the third thing. And this, ladies and gentlemen, is the magic of Mexico ðŸ‘ŒðŸ”®

## Kansas City, here I come

That same week on Friday, my last day in Austin, I get an email from the Kansas City consulate saying that my application has been accepted and my appointment is next week Thursday.

I was happy but now had another decision to make. Do I catch a flight back to Mexico on Saturday? Or do I buy a flight to Chicago and meet up with my friends there? So without making a decision, I went to bed, and the next morning one hour before the flight to Chicago I bought the ticket.

Fast forward a few days later, it was Wednesday and I was on a plane to Kansas City leaving Chicago. Turns out that week there were a lot of tornados and the flight was very turbulent. When I arrived in Kansas City massive gusts of wind were ravaging the city to the point where I could barely walk, it was insane.

The next day, however, the weather was perfect as if nothing happened. I arrived at the Mexican consulate, he said I was lucky as there was no power this morning and they just got it, which meant they could process my visa. Thirty minutes later, I walked out with the visa stamp in my passport, caught an Uber, and went straight to the airport.

## Back to Mexico

I was back in Mexico the same day. Unfortunately, I couldn't get my residency card on Friday as the office was shutting down for the Christmas holidays. I met up with the lawyer that day and I had two options:

1. Book a normal appointment and wait 2-3 months for it, but that meant I couldn't leave the country unless I get a special exemption.
2. Pay them an extra fee to get the process expedited ðŸ˜‰

So I went with Option 2. I waited the holidays out and the moment immigration opened, which was the 2nd of January, I was there to receive my card.

Boom, I am now a Mexican Permanent Resident ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½. After all of this stress and worry, it finally felt great to relax.

Looking at it now, of course, I would've done things differently but hey, there wouldn't be such an epic and stressful story.

However, it is an opportunity for you, the reader, to do things differently if you wish to do so. Below, is a step-by-step process, so you don't have to waste time and figure stuff out. I hope you find it useful. ðŸ¤™

Here is a quick cost breakdown:

* Consulate Fee: $40 USD
* Immigration Fee: $5,776 MXN or $288 USD
* Lawyer Expedite Fee: $600 USD (Optional)
* Printing, Photos, etc: $10 USD
* **Total:** $938 USD

As I mentioned before I'm not including the costs of flights and everything else, as if you do it in your home country before coming to Mexico then it will be free for you.

## How to Get Permanent or Temporary Residency in Mexico: Step by Step Guide

No matter where you live the process will be roughly the same.

### 1. Find the nearest Mexican consulate in your country of residence. List of consulates here. https://embamex.sre.gob.mx/

**Note:**

* It has to be in the country where you live and have a place of residency. So if you are from the USA, then find one in the USA.
* **Quick hack:** I was in the position where I went to Kansas City, USA because they accepted my printed documents despite being a New Zealand citizen and not having the documents verified. This worked out nicely for me and can work out for you too. You have to email them and ask.
* If you are in Mexico already, you will have to fly out to the consulate of where you have the appointment. For me, it was Kansas City.

### 2. Email or call them asking for the latest requirements to get the Temporary or Permanent Residency.

**Note:**

* I emailed them and got a response within a few days. It looked like this:

***Permanent Residence Visa***

* *Copy of valid passport with a minimum validity of 6 month (only the page that contains your information and photo)*
* *Copy of document(s) to prove financial solvency through one of the following documents:*
* *a) Bank statements or SSA letter which indicates a monthly income from Social Security benefits, Pension, or Retirement for at least of $3,500.00 USD for the past 6 months,* ***or***
* *b) Monthly Statements of assets (investments, savings or checking account) for at least of $135,000.00 USD for the past 12 months.*
* *One color photo, size passport, front view, without glasses*
* *Money order or cash for $44.00 USD. Please be advised that this fee is not refundable and does not guarantee that the visa will be granted*
* *Duly filled and signed visa application (attached please find the form)*

*The documents must be dropped off or mailed to: Consulate of Mexico, Visas Section,* 1617 Baltimore Ave., Kansas City, MO 64108.

***Temporary Residence Visa***

It is the same as Permanent Residence Visa in terms of documents, except for the amount of economic solvency you have to prove.

* *a) Last six bank statements where you receive any kind of pension or salary with a monthly average minimum of $2,068.00 (the complete official statement month by month, with full name and address â€“ NO P.O. Box)*
* *b) Last twelve months statements of your investments with a minimum balance of $34,460.00 (the complete official statement month by month, with full name and address â€“ NO P.O. Box).*

**Important:**

* This data was for December 2021. Make sure you find out the latest requirements from your consulate, as the requirements tend to increase.

**What is the difference between Permanent and Temporary Residency?**

* Obviously the Permanent you become a permanent resident in Mexico and in 5 years' time you can apply for citizenship. You can come and leave the country whenever you want.
* With Temporary, you get a residency card for 4 years. After 1 year, you have to come back to Mexico and get it renewed for the next 3 years. And only after 4 years, you can get a permanent residency.

### 3. Gather the required documents and fees and MAIL them. I used DHL.

**Note:**

* I tried emailing them but it didn't work, despite them saying that they would accept it.
* The moment I mailed physical documents, I got a response from them within a few days.

### 4. Wait for their response of acceptance or rejection. If accepted, they will tell you when you need to come in to pick up the visa.

**Note:**

* I sent my documents on Monday and got a reply from them on Friday, the same week.

### 5. Attend the appointment, get your photo taken and visa put into your passport.

**Note:**

* This visa is temporary and is only used to enter Mexico.
* You will have 6 months to enter Mexico after receiving this visa.

### 6. Fly into Mexico and receive a 30 days entry visa.

**Note:**

* When entering the Mexico, you will need to fill out the entry card.
* I don't remember the options but don't put it as a tourist one. Your lawyer or consulate should tell you which option to put.

### 7. Now you have 30 days to book an appointment with immigration.

**Note:**

* If your appointment is past the 30 days period of your visa, that's not a problem, as long as you have booked an appointment.
* For this step, **I used a lawyer** to sort out the appointment and so on. **I recommend** finding a local lawyer, meaning if you are going to Cancun then don't use a Mexico City lawyer.
* I didn't use a local lawyer the first time, and communication and everything was just an extra hassle. Don't get me wrong it worked and they can sort everything out for you but in the end, I liked the convenience of having my lawyer locally, and the ability to see them in person.
* The lawyer also helped me "expedite" the immigration waiting time for an extra fee. Instead of waiting for 2 months, my residency card was done in 2 days.

### 8. Go to your Immigration appointment, get your photo taken and receive your Permanent or Temporary Residence Card.

**Note:**

* Here it is super simple, you wait for your name to be called out.
* Answer a few simple questions and get your photo taken.

### 9. Congratulations, you are now a Mexican resident! It is time for a margarita or a passion fruit mezcalitaâ€¦ those are the best ðŸ‘Œ

**The benefits:**

* Stay in the country however you long
* Enjoy local discounts on events, restaurants, tourist attractions, and so on
* Setup a tax system that can help you pay less tax
* and I'm sure countless other benefits that I'm forgetting to include
