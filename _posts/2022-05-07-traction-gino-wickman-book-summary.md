description: "A comprehensive summary of Gino Wickman's 'Traction', providing actionable insights for entrepreneurs to strengthen their business's six key components and achieve operational excellence."
---

This summary took me longer than expected and there is a good reason for that. The book is full of gems so I had to pause every 10-20 seconds to write it down and listening to an audiobook didn't help.

Either way, I hope you will find this summary useful, just like me, and will be able to implement it in your business. This is what I'm currently doing and honestly, will try to do the same in my personal life.

The way I've done the summary is I broke it down by chapters and key points in those chapters. Should be pretty simple to follow. The book came with PDFs, and unfortunately, I don't have them, but I think quick Google will help you out there.

Lastly, this summary is more of a guide ("a refresher") to be used while you are reading or listening to this book. Feel free to copy and add your notes to it. And if you want me to make any changes or add to my notes, let me know please üôè.

With that being said, let's dive right in.

## Chapter 1: The Entrepreneurial Operating: Strengthening the Six Key Components

This chapter basically covers the 6 components to focus on in the business and later breaks them down.

### EOS - 6 components are:

* **Vision**

## Chapter 4: The People Component - Surround Yourself with Good People

* Right people in the right seats
* The right people are the ones that share companies core values, they thrive in the organisation and are people you enjoy being around and who make the organisation a better place to be.
* Core Values + People Analyser = The Right People
* Right Seat = Each of my employees operates within the area of greatest skill & passion, and role / expectations fit within that
* Everyone has a unique ability & need to improve it, feels energised. Passion to drive further and improve
* **What is my unique ability?**
* Structure to Function Efficiently
* Accountability Chart
  * Unique Ability + Accountability Chart = Right Seats
* **Right Person + Wrong Seat**
  * He/she is there because they been around for a long time and been promoting them, cause we like them
  * In actuality, hindering the person's growth
  * Move out of the seat and move where they can be successful
  * If no seat is available, then have to make a tough decision & let them go
* **Wrong Person + Right Seat**
  * Person excels in the tasks and is in unique ability
  * What makes them wrong?
    * Doesn't share the values and as a result killing the organisation
    * The person can have no values or lack integrity
    * For example, a really good sales person, but is shady
* **Wrong Person + Wrong Seat**
  * The person must go
* The job is to hire / fire the people around core values and their unique abilities

### Right People

* What are our Core Values?
  * Now that we know, we have to keep them in mind
* People Analyser
  * List the names of people
  * Put the core values
  * Rate by +, +/-, -
  * The ideal is to surround people that are 100% + BUT this is ideal
  * **Need to identify with leaders what is acceptable and what is not, then hold managers accountable to it**
  * If the company has 5 Core Values (recommendation)
    * 3 +
    * 2 +/-
    * Never a minus
* **The 3 Strike Rule**
  * 1: Discuss issues and expectations - **30 days**
  * 2: If no improvement, discuss performance again - **30 days**
  * 3: If still no improvement, he/she must go and won't be seen any improvements - **30 days**
* By reiterating the values to the people, the idea is that will weed them out before even getting to the 3 Strike Rule
* Need to be clear around roles, values, and expectations

**People analyser check**

1. People analyse each other
   1. If we are all weak in one value then we should question whether it makes sense to have it
   2. Someone on the leadership is below the bar - **must follow 3 strike rule**
2. Leadership team people analyse everyone in the organisation and have them share with you
3. Use in Quarterly performance review to analyse you by your team
   1. Don't be afraid to put money where the mouth is
4. If leadership is struggling with people, run the person through the people analyser
   1. If its the person, then run the **Strike Rule**
   2. If its the seat, then‚Ä¶ üëá

### Right Seats üí∫

* Once confident we have the right people, we get the right seats
* Abilities along with roles + responsibilities
* Seat **cannot** be created until the organisation is structured in the right way

**Accountability Chart**

* What is the right structure for our organisation to move it forward for next 6-12 months?

You have to:

1. Look forward
2. Detach yourself from current business, role & ego
3. Elevate above the business and look down on it to make decisions for the long term of the company

**Exercise: 3 Major Functions in the Business - ALL MUST BE STRONG**

1. Sales & Marketing - generate business
   1. Can split into:
      1. Sales Function
      2. Marketing Function
2. Operations - provides the service & takes care of the customer
   1. Delivery
   2. Project Management
   3. Customer Service
3. Finance - manages the money in / out
   1. Finance
   2. Admin
   3. IT
   4. Human Resources
4. **Note:**
   1. Only 1 person must run each department
   2. If more than 1, then no one is accountable
   3. When leadership teams do this exercise, they have two or more people in the same box.
      1. Only clear accountability will boost us in the right direction
5. Less is More
   1. No more than 7 major functions

### The Integrator

* A person who harmoniously integrates major functions of the business
* Tensions & friction will happen between departments and the integrator smoothes them out
* Can be called CEO / General Manager / King etc
* Unique ability to run the organisation, manages day-to-day issues that arise, and integrate the 3 major functions
* The integrator is the glue that holds the company together

They are:

* Good at leading, managing, and holding people accountable
* Love running day to day aspect of the business
* Accountable for Profit and Loss + business plan for organisation
* Remove obstacles so the business can continue to execute
* Great at special projects
* They operate more on logic

### The Visionary

* Has 10 new ideas a week, 9 of them aren't great but 1 of them is what keeps the organisation growing
* Very creative
* Solvers of big problems, not tiny ones
* Fantastic with important vendors, clients and so on
* The culture of the organisation is important
* Operate on Emotion
* 5 Major Roles
  * R&D
  * Ideas
  * Creative Problem Solving
  * Relationships
  * Selling

> **When structured correctly, then the dynamic within the orgnisation can be magical**

### CLEAR ROLES & ACCOUNTABILITY

* Clear accountability takes the organisatoin to next level

**It is common for a company to have a visionary and no integrator**

* Visionaries are constantly frustrated with lack of traction and get pulled into day-to-day

**Process**

1. Create the organisation structure first with major roles in each function
2. Then put the right people in the right seats

**Communication**

* Should flow freely between departments and be open
* There shouldn't be silos or division between team

**GWC**

* **Get it**
  * Understand their role
* **Want It**
  * Genuinely like the job, want to do it based on fair compensation & responsibility
* **Capacity to do it**
  * Time, physical and mental capacity to do
  * Sometimes job requires 50 hours but person can only do 40
  * Or specific knowledge, intellect & emotional intelligence
* **Note**
  * This helps analyse if the person Gets it, Wants it and has Capacity to do it
  * The people don't fully perform don't have all 3
  * "To reach the next level we need people that given the ball can run with it"
  * When managers clearly articulate the seat, reporting & expectations then you create an opening that creates:
    * Step & take charge
    * OR they never do
  * In that role, I'll be frustrated and so are they and nothing gets done
  * A NO to any of these 3 means its not the right seat for this person - not their unique ability
    * If you have the time to elevate that person, then its a maybe
  * Rating
    * Must have Yes or No
    * Must have 3 Yes for a person to be considered he is in the right seat

**One Name + 2 Seats**

* Can have that but not 2 Names in 1 Seat
* When organisation starts the founders occupy all seats
* Depending on the size of organisation
  * Having 1 person in multiply seats is okay, if there is TIME
  * If not, then that has to change

**Delegate & Elevate**

* You have to rise to your unique ability
* With accountability chart, we can only see if the person is working at full capacity
  * For some its 40 hours, for some its 70 hours - everyone is different
* If taking up too much time being in 2 seats, the person needs to learn to delegate to other people so can reach and focus on unique ability
* When delegating you have to be comfortable that the person is in the right seat, otherwise will have no confidence

**Terminations**

* Once you become clear don't run out and fire everyone
* Take a methodical approach making sure that everyone in the leadership is on the same page and take it step by step
* Once you do the necessary pruning the organisation will revitalise
* **People must add value**
* **If everyone is in the right seat, everyone is happier**

**Questions to ask at the end of the Accountability Chart:**

1. Is this the right structure to get us to the next level?
2. Are all the right people in the right seats?
3. Does everyone have enough time to do the job well?

Key to success:

> **Right People + Right Values + Right Seats + GWC + Unique Ability**

## Chapter 5: The Data Component - Safety in Numbers

* Only factual information can provide information to make better decisions

### #1 Scorecard

* Anything that is measured and watched is improved
* A handful of numbers to tell us how the business is doing
* P&L is too late to make corrections
  * Issue is data comes after the fact and it is too late to make corrections
* You want to track the patterns on weekly basis
* It has to be simple tracking

**Scorecard Steps - Finance Person Can Fill Out the Scorecard**

1. Decide and list the categories that we need to track on weekly basis?
   1. Piece of paper with numbers on it
   2. Categories
      1. Weekly revenue
      2. Cash balances
      3. Weekly Sales Activities
      4. NPS / Problems
      5. AR / AP
      6. Client Project / Production Status
   3. Rule of thumb
      1. 5-15 numbers
      2. Keep it simple
2. Who is accountable for each?
   1. Person in charge of that function
   2. This is the person that MUST deliver that weekly number
3. What is the expected goal is for the week for each category?
   1. Tied directly to the 1 year plan
4. Put in next week date
   1. 90 days at a time, so about 12 - 13 weeks total
5. Decide who is accountable for collecting the numbers & fill in
   1. How will receive the numbers?
6. Use it
   1. Keep the history too

**3 Scorecard Rules of Thumb**

1. The numbers should be weekly activity based numbers
   1. The score card is not P&L but acts as a prediction whether we are on track for strong P&L
   2. Example
      1. New sales numbers that come in
      2. Number of new leads generated
         1. Number of contacts
         2. Number of closes / proposals etc
      3. Client Satisfaction
         1. What factors drive happy customers?
2. Proactive tool to anticipate problems before they happen
   1. Still need to monitor P&L and budgets
3. When managing a scorecard clients find value in red flagging
   1. If the number set is not hit, then shade that number using the colour RED

### #2 Measurables

* What gets measured gets DONE
* Everyone has single measurable number to guide their work
  * Creates clarity throughout the team
* Everyone has a number
  * Numbers cut through the communication
    * No longer watered down answers "This week is going great"
  * Numbers create accountability
  * Accountable people appreciate numbers
    * Wrong people in wrong seats resist numbers
    * Right people want to win
  * Numbers create clarity and commitment
  * Numbers create competition
  * Numbers produce results
    * What gets watched improves
  * Numbers create teamwork
    * Ask themselves "How can we hit that number?"
  * Numbers solve problems faster
* Creating a transparent organisation where nowhere to hide

## Chapter 6: The issues component - Decide

* Be disciplined and solve organisation issues as they arise
* In the organisation where there is nothing to hide, problems will be resolved quickly
* Human nature is to put off hard decisions
* Ability to succeed is in proportionate to the ability to solve problems
  * The better you are at solving problems the more successful you are
* **Biggest Failure Point - Lack of decision & procrastination**
* Every millionaire / successful entrepreneur
  * Reaches decision promptly and then changes them slowly
* **What drains the energy?**
  * Not lots of work to do, but unresolved issues
* It is less important what you decide vs that you decide
  * More is lost by indecision vs wrong decisions

### The Issues List

* Create a workplace where people are comfortable to point out issues that hinder vision
* Leadership needs to be open with each other
* High level of trust is what makes the team healthy & functional
* 3 Types of Issues Lists
  * Issues lists in VTO
    * Tackled at the end of the quarters or further out
    * These issues don't fall in the immediate category but need to be tracked, so the team doesn't lose sight of them
    * For example
      * New product ideas
      * Office relocations
      * HR policies
  * Weekly leadership issues list
    * Resolved in weekly meetings
    * We don't resolve departmental issues
      * If can be resolved at department level then push it down
    * Issues include
      * Company rocks offtrack
      * Bad number in scorecard
      * Key employee issues
      * Client issues
      * Process problems
  * Departmental issues list
    * Related to each specific department
    * If no issues, then can try the following
      * Bring 2 issues every week for the meeting
      * If none, then they can't attend the meeting

### The Issues Solving Track

* Why usually nothing gets resolved within leaders?
  * Fear of conflict
  * Lack of focus
  * Lack of Commitment
  * Personal Ego
* There is more efficient way to solve things
* **Steps to find solutions**
  * **Identify**
    * Examine and decide on top 3 issues to solve
    * Don't go from top to bottom, identify important ones
    * Clearly identify the real issue, as stated issue is not usually the real one
      * Most causes of real issues are people
    * Can take the longest time vs other steps, as it takes time to get to the route cause
    * Issues owners responsibility to make it clear what is the issue
  * **Discuss**
    * Most time spent here but the issue is it hasn't been identified
    * Opportunity to say what they think but only once
    * Have to fight for greater good and benefit the whole company vs you as individual or your team
    * **The #'1 reason most teams keep talking is because they go on Tangents**
      * Get in the habit of pointing out Tangents
      * Then put it on the issue list

## Chapter 7: The process component - finding your way

* The secret to success - Consistency
* Nothing can be fine-tuned unless its consistent
* Have to understand the core processes - on average 7 that make up our unique business model
* Need to make sure everyone within the organisation understands
* What are all the moving parts within the business?
  * Take time to view from the top
  * Can't be in the systems while understanding the system you are in. Need to raise the system from time to time
* Identify Process + Documenting + Everyone Follow it = Clear Way
  * No longer let the business run you
  * From there you can sell the business, let someone run it, or take time off
* 2 major steps
  * Document the core processes
  * Followed by all

### Documenting The Core Processes

* Three stages
  * **Identify core processes**
    * Schedule an hour with the leadership team, so can call the processes the same name
    * Need to identify and agree what the name is
    * Core process include
      * HR - search / fire / promote / retain people
      * Marketing - get message to target audience and generate interest to what we do
      * Sales - process of converting prospect to a customer
      * Operations - the way you make the product or provide service to customer
        * Project Management
        * Logistic
        * Warehouse Distribution
        * Service Technician
      * Accounting - flow / management of money coming in and out
      * Customer Retention - proactive way you take care of your customers and retain them after
    * Leadership teams need to be 100% on the same page with names and processes
    * Everyone will speak the same language
    * Need to call the processes that way from the start
  * **Document what happens in each one of them**
    * Accountability chart comes into play as the person responsible for each department takes charge of documenting it
      * Head of Sales takes Sales processes etc
    * Follow 20/80 Rule when documenting
      * Document 20% of processes that bring 80% of results aka document at high level
      * Document steps at high level with procedures underneath them
    * By documenting, it will help to bring the processes to light and present an opportunity to dumb them down
    * Processes should be bulletproof
      * Checklists have a huge benefit
    * If one of you disappear tomorrow, can it be followed
  * **Compile information in single package for everyone in the company**
    * Put it all together and save it in a shared drive

### Followed by all

* When followed by all, it is much easier to manage and spot where the issues are
* The leadership team must be convinced that everyone needs to follow 1 system
* Most of the time the step fails is because the owner doesn't follow the process
  * Because if you don't see the value, how the people can
* The best way to convince your employees is to show a clear way of what it looks like
* Action steps
  * Create a visual
  * Schedule a meeting or share it at the next quarterly meeting
  * Retrain everyone
  * Manage your people to follow the process

## Chapter 8: Traction

* Bridge the gap between vision and execution
* Bringing discipline into organisation will make people a bit uncomfortable
* Two disciplines to gain traction
  * Set specific measurable priorities aka **Rocks**
  * Meet better as organisation aka **Meeting Pulse**

### Rocks

* Short term priorities towards the vision
* Establish 3-7 priorities for the next 90 days
  * **aka Rocks**
* Break it down into bite sized focus projects so then it's achievable and not overwhelming
* Every department, as it trickles down to employees, will have rocks
* The aim is to move company forward 90 days at a time
* Once you set the company rocks and leadership rocks, then communicate these rocks to the organisation so they can set theirs
  * This creates alignment
* Work on rocks first and everything else will fall into place
* Do Less Accomplish More
  * Fewer priorities are better
* **Process**
  * Every 90 days the team meets for a day
  * Reviews the vision
  * Determines the rocks based on that
* **Establishing the Rocks**
  * List everything on the white board to accomplish in the next 90 days
    * 10-20 items list
  * Discuss, Debate & Determine the most important priorities
    * Kill , Keep or Combine
    * Down to 3-7 priorities
  * Set the date when the rocks are due
    * Usually by end of the Quarter
  * Define Each one by making sure objective are clear
    * Specific, Manageable, Attainable
    * It's not vague, must be clear so no ambiguity at the end of the quarter that it was done or not
  * Assign who owns each rock
    * Owned by 1 person on the leadership team
    * When more than 1 is accountable then no one is accountable
  * Once the company rocks are set, leadership team sets their own rocks
    * Come up with most 3-7
    * Some company rocks can become personal
    * Other rocks can be moved forward
  * Create the Rock Sheet
    * Top organisation rocks
    * Leadership rocks below
    * Used in Weekly Meetings Review
    * **Note:**
      * Once the rocks are set, no new ones are to be added even if its a genius idea
  * Share company rocks with entire organisation
    * Meet with the organisation to share success, progress and VTO
  * Have each dept set their rocks as a team
    * Follow same process as a leadership team
    * While leadership and company have rocks of 3-7, everyone else (employees) will have 1-3
* **Rocks Pitfalls**
  * Garbage in, Garbage Out
    * If set wrong rocks, then will be spent in the wrong direction
    * Takes 2 quarters to master rocks - true mastery comes from experience
  * Commitment fizzle
    * Make sure you are committed to your rocks and you commit to quarterly routine
  * Too many rocks
    * Don't give people more than 3 rocks
    * Accountability is too much

### Meeting Pulse

* Let's dispel the myth that meetings are a waste of time
* To gain more traction, we will most likely need to do more meetings than we currently do
* A meeting pulse with specific agenda will keep the organisation healthy
  * By setting more frequent meetings to review progress, for example, will create a spike to get stuff done
* **Two types of meetings**
  * Quarterly
  * Weekly

## Chapter 10: Getting Started

* **Sequence / Order of Implementation**
  * Accountability Chart - People Analyse & GWC
  * Rocks
  * Meeting Pulse - IDS, Lvl 10 meeting, quarterly and annuals
  * ScoreCard
  * VTO - core values, core focus
  * 3 step process documented
  * Everyone has a number

Hope you found this summary useful.

Personally, I started implementing the values first and reviewed them. Then I quickly tried to implement the core focus and goals, which translated into Rocks.

I feel this book can be implemented rather quickly, if the organisation is small, and improved over time. The key is doing it and learning along the way, as this book mentions it few times.

The main challenge I'm currently facing is:

* Identifying the 3-10 year goals, as I'm not sure if I see myself in that particular business that long. So need to adjust there.
* And if I don't see myself that long, then what are the steps from here.
