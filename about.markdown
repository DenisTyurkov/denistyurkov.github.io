Hey everyone

Denis here, an adventurous guy exploring life. About 7 years ago I quit my corporate job to learn web development at a coding bootcamp. My goal was to start a business and travel the world. Fast forward 7 years, I did exactly that.

You can find more about it here: [6 Years After I quit my corporate job]({{ site.baseurl }}/6-years-after-i-quit-my-corporate-job).

And now, I'm trying to figure out the next phase in my life. Currently, my mind is like the headphones when you put them in your pocket... tangled, and I'm trying to untangle it to find clarity in my direction so I can listen to the music of life without any issues once again.

I hope you join me on this journey. ✈️
