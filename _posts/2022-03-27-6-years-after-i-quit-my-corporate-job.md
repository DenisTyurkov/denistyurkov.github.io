Hey everyone,

6 years ago, I was working as an Auditor in a big accounting company, just 6 months away from getting my Chartered Accountant (CA) qualification. Instead, I decided this life was not for me and submitted my resignation.

Since then, I've:
- Co-founded [www.glimp.co.nz](http://www.glimp.co.nz), a comparison website in New Zealand
- Lived and traveled in multiple countries including:
  - ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡© Bali
  - ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡· Brazil
  - ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸ Spain
  - ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ Goa, India
  - ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º Russia

Key areas of personal growth included:
- Work: Building a 7-figure remote business
- Travel: Exploring multiple countries
- Personal Development: Becoming more self-aware
- Fitness: Establishing consistent workout routines
- Investing: Starting to build investment portfolio

Currently residing in Mexico, continuing to explore, learn, and grow.
