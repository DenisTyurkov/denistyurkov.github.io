---

This summary took me longer than expected and there is a good reason for that. The book is full of gems so I had to pause every 10-20 seconds to write it down and listening to an audiobook didn't help.

Either way, I hope you will find this summary useful, just like me, and will be able to implement it in your business. This is what I'm currently doing and honestly, will try to do the same in my personal life.

The way I've done the summary is I broke it down by chapters and key points in those chapters. Should be pretty simple to follow. The book came with PDFs, and unfortunately, I don't have them, but I think quick Google will help you out there.

Lastly, this summary is more of a guide ("a refresher") to be used while you are reading or listening to this book. Feel free to copy and add your notes to it. And if you want me to make any changes or add to my notes, let me know please 🙏.

With that being said, let's dive right in.

## Chapter 4: The People Component - Surround Yourself with Good People

* Right people in the right seats
* The right people are the ones that share companies core values, they thrive in the organisation and are people you enjoy being around and who make the organisation a better place to be.
* Core Values + People Analyser = The Right People
* Right Seat = Each of my employees operates within the area of greatest skill & passion, and role / expectations fit within that
* Everyone has a unique ability & need to improve it, feels energised. Passion to drive further and improve
* **What is my unique ability?**
* Structure to Function Efficiently
* Accountability Chart
  * Unique Ability + Accountability Chart = Right Seats
* **Right Person + Wrong Seat**
  * He/she is there because they been around for a long time and been promoting them, cause we like them
  * In actuality, hindering the person's growth
  * Move out of the seat and move where they can be successful
  * If no seat is available, then have to make a tough decision & let them go
* **Wrong Person + Right Seat**
  * Person excels in the tasks and is in unique ability
  * What makes them wrong?
    * Doesn't share the values and as a result killing the organisation
    * The person can have no values or lack integrity
    * For example, a really good sales person, but is shady
* **Wrong Person + Wrong Seat**
  * The person must go
* The job is to hire / fire the people around core values and their unique abilities

### Right People

* What are our Core Values?
  * Now that we know, we have to keep them in mind
* People Analyser
  * List the names of people
  * Put the core values
  * Rate by +, +/-, -
  * The ideal is to surround people that are 100% + BUT this is ideal
  * **Need to identify with leaders what is acceptable and what is not, then hold managers accountable to it**
  * If the company has 5 Core Values (recommendation)
    * 3 +
    * 2 +/-
    * Never a minus
* **The 3 Strike Rule**
  * 1: Discuss issues and expectations - **30 days**
  * 2: If no improvement, discuss performance again - **30 days**
  * 3: If still no improvement, he/she must go and won't be seen any improvements - **30 days**
* By reiterating the values to the people, the idea is that will weed them out before even getting to the 3 Strike Rule
* Need to be clear around roles, values, and expectations

**People analyser check**

1. People analyse each other
   1. If we are all weak in one value then we should question whether it makes sense to have it
   2. Someone on the leadership is below the bar - **must follow 3 strike rule**
2. Leadership team people analyse everyone in the organisation and have them share with you
3. Use in Quarterly performance review to analyse you by your team
   1. Don't be afraid to put money where the mouth is
4. If leadership is struggling with people, run the person through the people analyser
   1. If its the person, then run the **Strike Rule**
   2. If its the seat, then… 👇

### Right Seats 💺

* Once confident we have the right people, we get the right seats
* Abilities along with roles + responsibilities
* Seat **cannot** be created until the organisation is structured in the right way

**Accountability Chart**

* What is the right structure for our organisation to move it forward for next 6-12 months?

You have to:

1. Look forward
2. Detach yourself from current business, role & ego
3. Elevate above the business and look down on it to make decisions for the long term of the company

**Exercise: 3 Major Functions in the Business - ALL MUST BE STRONG**

1. Sales & Marketing - generate business
   1. Can split into:
      1. Sales Function
      2. Marketing Function
2. Operations - provides the service & takes care of the customer
   1. Delivery
   2. Project Management
   3. Customer Service
3. Finance - manages the money in / out
   1. Finance
   2. Admin
   3. IT
   4. Human Resources
4. **Note:**
   1. Only 1 person must run each department
   2. If more than 1, then no one is accountable
   3. When leadership teams do this exercise, they have two or more people in the same box.
      1. Only clear accountability will boost us in the right direction
5. Less is More
   1. No more than 7 major functions

### The Integrator

* A person who harmoniously integrates major functions of the business
* Tensions & friction will happen between departments and the integrator smoothes them out
* Can be called CEO / General Manager / King etc
* Unique ability to run the organisation, manages day-to-day issues that arise, and integrate the 3 major functions
* The integrator is the glue that holds the company together

They are:

* Good at leading, managing, and holding people accountable
* Love running day to day aspect of the business
* Accountable for Profit and Loss + business plan for organisation
* Remove obstacles so the business can continue to execute
* Great at special projects
* They operate more on logic

### The Visionary

* Has 10 new ideas a week, 9 of them aren't great but 1 of them is what keeps the organisation growing
* Very creative
* Solvers of big problems, not tiny ones
* Fantastic with important vendors, clients and so on
* The culture of the organisation is important
* Operate on Emotion
* 5 Major Roles
  * R&D
  * Ideas
  * Creative Problem Solving
  * Relationships
  * Selling

> **When structured correctly, then the dynamic within the orgnisation can be magical**

### CLEAR ROLES & ACCOUNTABILITY

* Clear accountability takes the organisatoin to next level

**It is common for a company to have a visionary and no integrator**

* Visionaries are constantly frustrated with lack of traction and get pulled into day-to-day

**Process**

1. Create the organisation structure first with major roles in each function
2. Then put the right people in the right seats

**Communication**

* Should flow freely between departments and be open
* There shouldn't be silos or division between team

**GWC**

* **Get it**
  * Understand their role
* **Want It**
  * Genuinely like the job, want to do it based on fair compensation & responsibility
* **Capacity to do it**
  * Time, physical and mental capacity to do
  * Sometimes job requires 50 hours but person can only do 40
  * Or specific knowledge, intellect & emotional intelligence
* **Note**
  * This helps analyse if the person Gets it, Wants it and has Capacity to do it
  * The people don't fully perform don't have all 3
  * "To reach the next level we need people that given the ball can run with it"
  * When managers clearly articulate the seat, reporting & expectations then you create an opening that creates:
    * Step & take charge
    * OR they never do
  * In that role, I'll be frustrated and so are they and nothing gets done
  * A NO to any of these 3 means its not the right seat for this person - not their unique ability
    * If you have the time to elevate that person, then its a maybe
  * Rating
    * Must have Yes or No
    * Must have 3 Yes for a person to be considered he is in the right seat

**One Name + 2 Seats**

* Can have that but not 2 Names in 1 Seat
* When organisation starts the founders occupy all seats
* Depending on the size of organisation
  * Having 1 person in multiply seats is okay, if there is TIME
  * If not, then that has to change

**Delegate & Elevate**

* You have to rise to your unique ability
* With accountability chart, we can only see if the person is working at full capacity
  * For some its 40 hours, for some its 70 hours - everyone is different
* If taking up too much time being in 2 seats, the person needs to learn to delegate to other people so can reach and focus on unique ability
* When delegating you have to be comfortable that the person is in the right seat, otherwise will have no confidence

**Terminations**

* Once you become clear don't run out and fire everyone
* Take a methodical approach making sure that everyone in the leadership is on the same page and take it step by step
* Once you do the necessary pruning the organisation will revitalise
* **People must add value**
* **If everyone is in the right seat, everyone is happier**

**Questions to ask at the end of the Accountability Chart:**

1. Is this the right structure to get us to the next level?
2. Are all the right people in the right seats?
3. Does everyone have enough time to do the job well?

Key to success:

> **Right People + Right Values + Right Seats + GWC + Unique Ability**

## Chapter 5: The Data Component - Safety in Numbers

* Only factual information can provide information to make better decisions

### #1 Scorecard

* Anything that is measured and watched is improved
* A handful of numbers to tell us how the business is doing
* P&L is too late to make corrections
  * Issue is data comes after the fact and it is too late to make corrections
* You want to track the patterns on weekly basis
* It has to be simple tracking

**Scorecard Steps - Finance Person Can Fill Out the Scorecard**

1. Decide and list the categories that we need to track on weekly basis?
   1. Piece of paper with numbers on it
   2. Categories
      1. Weekly revenue
      2. Cash balances
      3. Weekly Sales Activities
      4. NPS / Problems
      5. AR / AP
      6. Client Project / Production Status
   3. Rule of thumb
      1. 5-15 numbers
      2. Keep it simple
2. Who is accountable for each?
   1. Person in charge of that function
   2. This is the person that MUST deliver that weekly number
3. What is the expected goal is for the week for each category?
   1. Tied directly to the 1 year plan
4. Put in next week date
   1. 90 days at a time into the future

The summary captures the book's core message: "Vision without traction is merely hallucination."
