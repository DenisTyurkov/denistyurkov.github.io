## How to get a discount on Airbnb?

This is how I recently got a $1,000 discount on Airbnb. I was in Playa del Carmen, Mexico and had to move out within 1 week.

### Timing
- Do this 1 week before travel or close to travel date
- Landlords want to fill spaces and earn money
- Can also book months in advance for more options

### The Process
1. Find accommodation on Airbnb
2. Email the Host
3. Contact host directly via Airbnb
4. Use a prepared script
5. Wait for reply
6. Evaluate offers
7. Accept preferred option

### Alternative Approach
- Find property contact outside Airbnb
- **Warning:** This risks platform ban
